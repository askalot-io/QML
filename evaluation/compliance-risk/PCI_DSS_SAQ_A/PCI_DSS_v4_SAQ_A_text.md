Completing the Self-Assessment Questionnaire

Merchant Eligibility Criteria for Self-Assessment Questionnaire A
Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) A includes only those PCI DSS requirements applicable to
merchants with account data functions completely outsourced to PCI DSS validated and compliant third
parties, where the merchant retains only paper reports or receipts with account data.

SAQ A merchants may be either e-commerce or mail/telephone-order merchants (card-not-present) and
do not store, process, or transmit any account data in electronic format on their systems or premises.

                            This SAQ is not applicable to face-to-face channels.
                              This SAQ is not applicable to service providers.
SAQ A merchants confirm that, for this payment channel:
     The merchant accepts only card-not-present (e-commerce or mail/telephone-order) transactions;
     All processing of account data is entirely outsourced to PCI DSS compliant third-party service
      provider (TPSP)/payment processor;
     The merchant does not electronically store, process, or transmit any account data on merchant
      systems or premises, but relies entirely on a TPSP(s) to handle all these functions;
     The merchant has reviewed the PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance form(s) for its TPSP(s) and
      confirmed that TPSP(s) are PCI DSS compliant for the services being used by the merchant; and
     Any account data the merchant might retain is on paper (for example, printed reports or receipts),
      and these documents are not received electronically.

  Additionally, for e-commerce channels:
     All elements of the payment page(s)/form(s) delivered to the customer’s browser originate only and
      directly from a PCI DSS compliant TPSP/payment processor.

This SAQ includes only those requirements that apply to a specific type of merchant environment, as
defined in the above eligibility criteria. If there are PCI DSS requirements applicable to the cardholder data
environment that are not covered in this SAQ, it may be an indication that this SAQ is not suitable for the
merchant’s environment.

Note: For this SAQ, PCI DSS Requirements that address the protection of computer systems (for
example, Requirements 2, 6, and 8) apply to e-commerce merchants that redirect customers from their
website to a third party for payment processing, and specifically to the merchant web server upon which
the redirection mechanism is located. Mail order/telephone order (MOTO) or e-commerce merchants that
have completely outsourced all operations (where there is no redirection mechanism from the merchant to
the third party) and therefore do not have any systems in scope for this SAQ, would consider these
requirements to be “not applicable.” Refer to guidance on the following pages for how to report
requirements that are not applicable.

For SAQ A and e-commerce channels, PCI DSS requirements that refer to the “cardholder data
environment” are applicable to the merchant website(s) that provides the address (the URL) of the TPSP’s
payment page/form to merchant customers. This is because the merchant website impacts how the
account data is transmitted, even though the website itself does not receive account data.

Defining Account Data, Cardholder Data, and Sensitive Authentication Data

PCI DSS is intended for all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) and/or sensitive authentication data (SAD) or could impact the security of the cardholder data environment (CDE). Cardholder data and sensitive authentication data are considered account data and are defined as follows:

                                        Account Data

        Cardholder Data includes:                    Sensitive Authentication Data includes:

  • Primary Account Number (PAN)              • Full track data (magnetic-stripe data or equivalent on a chip)
  • Cardholder Name                           • Card verification code
  • Expiration Date                           • PINs/PIN blocks
  • Service Code

Refer to PCI DSS Section 2, PCI DSS Applicability Information, for further details.

PCI DSS Self-Assessment Completion Steps

1.  Confirm by review of the eligibility criteria in this SAQ and the Self-Assessment Questionnaire Instructions
    and Guidelines document on the PCI SSC website that this is the correct SAQ for the merchant's
    environment.

2.  Confirm that the merchant environment is properly scoped.

3.  Assess the environment for compliance with PCI DSS requirements.

4.  Complete all sections of this document:

        ▪  Section 1: Assessment Information (Parts 1 & 2 of the Attestation of Compliance (AOC) – Contact
           Information and Executive Summary).

        ▪  Section 2 – Self-Assessment Questionnaire A.

        ▪  Section 3: Validation and Attestation Details (Parts 3 & 4 of the AOC – PCI DSS Validation and Action
           Plan for Non-Compliant Requirements (if Part 4 is applicable)).

5.  Submit the SAQ and AOC, along with any other requested documentation—such as ASV scan reports—to
    the requesting organization (those organizations that manage compliance programs such as payment brands
    and acquirers).

Expected Testing

The instructions provided in the "Expected Testing" column are based on the testing procedures in PCI DSS and
provide a high-level description of the types of testing activities that a merchant is expected to perform to verify
that a requirement has been met.

The intent behind each testing method is described as follows:

        ▪  Examine: The merchant critically evaluates data evidence. Common examples include documents
           (electronic or physical), screenshots, configuration files, audit logs, and data files.

        ▪  Observe: The merchant watches an action or views something in the environment. Examples of observation
           subjects include personnel performing a task or process, system components performing a function or
           responding to input, environmental conditions, and physical controls.

--- page 6 ---

Interview: The merchant converses with individual personnel. Interview objectives may include confirmation of whether an activity is performed, descriptions of how an activity is performed, and whether personnel have particular knowledge or understanding.

The testing methods are intended to allow the merchant to demonstrate how it has met a requirement. The specific items to be examined or observed and personnel to be interviewed should be appropriate for both the requirement being assessed and the merchant's particular implementation.

Full details of testing procedures for each requirement can be found in PCI DSS.

Requirement Responses

For each requirement item, there is a choice of responses to indicate the merchant's status regarding that requirement. Only one response should be selected for each requirement item.

A description of the meaning for each response and when to use each response is provided in the table below:

Response                        When to use this response:

In Place                        The expected testing has been performed, and all elements of the requirement have
                                been met as stated.

In Place with CCW               The expected testing has been performed, and the requirement has been met with the
                                assistance of a compensating control.
(Compensating Controls
Worksheet)                      All responses in this column require completion of a Compensating Controls
                                Worksheet (CCW) in Appendix B of this SAQ.

                                Information on the use of compensating controls and guidance on how to complete
                                the worksheet is provided in PCI DSS in Appendices B and C.

In Place with Remediation       The requirement was Not in Place when the expected testing was initially performed,
                                but the merchant addressed the situation and put processes in place to prevent re-
                                occurrence prior to completion of the self-assessment. In all cases of In Place with
                                Remediation, the merchant has identified and addressed the reason the control failed,
                                has implemented the control, and has implemented ongoing processes to prevent re-
                                occurrence of the control failure.

                                All responses in this column require a supporting explanation in Appendix C of this
                                SAQ.

Not Applicable                  The requirement does not apply to the merchant's environment. (See "Guidance for
                                Not Applicable Requirements" below for examples.)All responses in this column
                                require a supporting explanation in Appendix D of this SAQ.

Not Tested                      This response is not applicable to, and not included as an option for, this SAQ.

                                This SAQ was created for a specific type of environment based on how the merchant
                                stores, processes, and/or transmits account data and defines the specific PCI DSS
                                requirements that apply for this environment. Consequently, all requirements in this
                                SAQ must be tested.

Not in Place                    Some or all elements of the requirement have not been met, or are in the process of
                                being implemented, or require further testing before the merchant can confirm they
                                are in place. Responses in this column may require the completion of Part 4, if
                                requested by the entity to which this SAQ will be submitted.

                                This response is also used if a requirement cannot be met due to a legal restriction.
                                (See "Legal Exception" below for more guidance)..

*Guidance for Not Applicable Requirements*

If any requirements do not apply to the merchant's environment, select the Not Applicable option for that specific requirement. For example, in this SAQ, requirements for securing all media with cardholder data (Requirements 9.4.1 - 9.4.6) only apply if a merchant stores paper media with cardholder data; if paper media is not stored, the merchant can select Not Applicable for those requirements.

For each response where Not Applicable is selected in this SAQ, complete *Appendix D: Explanation of Requirements Noted as Not Applicable*.

*Legal Exception*

If your organization is subject to a legal restriction that prevents the organization from meeting a PCI DSS requirement, select Not in Place for that requirement and complete the relevant attestation in Section 3, Part 3 of this SAQ.

*Note: A legal restriction is one where meeting the PCI DSS requirement would violate a local or regional law or regulation.*
*Contractual obligations or legal advice are not legal restrictions.*

*Use of the Customized Approach*

SAQs cannot be used to document use of the Customized Approach to meet PCI DSS requirements. For this reason, the Customized Approach Objectives are not included in SAQs. Entities wishing to validate using the Customized Approach may be able to use the PCI DSS Report on Compliance (ROC) Template to document the results of their assessment.

*Use of the Customized Approach is not supported in SAQs.*

The use of the customized approach may be regulated by organizations that manage compliance programs, such as payment brands and acquirers. Questions about use of a customized approach should always be referred to those organizations. This includes whether an entity that is eligible for an SAQ may instead complete a ROC to use a customized approach, and whether an entity is required to use a QSA, or may use an ISA, to complete an assessment using the customized approach. Information about the use of the Customized Approach can be found in Appendix D and E of PCI DSS.

        •  Processes for secure deletion or rendering account data
           unrecoverable when no longer needed per the retention
           policy.
        A process for verifying, at least once every three months,
        that stored account data exceeding the defined retention
        period has been securely deleted or rendered
        unrecoverable.

        Applicability Notes

        Where account data is stored by a TPSP (for example, in a cloud environment), entities are
        responsible for working with their service providers to understand how the TPSP meets this
        requirement for the entity. Considerations include ensuring that all geographic instances of
        a data element are securely deleted.
        The bullet above (for coverage of SAD stored prior to completion of authorization) is a best

SAQ Completion Guidance:

Selection of any of the In Place responses for Requirement 3.2.1 means that if a merchant stores any paper (for example, receipts or paper reports) that contain account data, the merchant only stores the paper as long as it is needed for business, legal, and/or regulatory reasons and destroys the paper once it is no longer needed.

If a merchant never prints or stores any paper containing account data, mark this requirement as Not Applicable and complete Appendix D: Explanation of Requirements Noted as Not Applicable.

        Applicability Notes

        Individuals approving media movements should have the appropriate level of management
        authority to grant this approval. However, it is not specifically required that such individuals have
        "manager" as part of their title.

9.4.6   Hard-copy materials with cardholder data are           •  Examine the periodic media         □       □           □               □           □

           reconstructed.
        •  Materials are stored in secure storage containers
           prior to destruction.

        Applicability Notes

        These requirements for media destruction when that media is no longer needed for business or
        legal reasons are separate and distinct from PCI DSS Requirement 3.2.1, which is for securely
        deleting cardholder data when no longer needed per the entity's cardholder data retention
        policies.

SAQ Completion Guidance:
Selection of any of the In Place responses for Requirements at 9.4 means that the merchant securely stores any paper media with account data, for example by
storing the paper in a locked drawer, cabinet, or safe, and that the merchant destroys such paper when no longer needed for business purposes. This includes a
written document or policy for employees, so they know how to secure paper with account data and how to destroy the paper when no longer needed.

If the merchant never stores any paper with account data, mark this requirement as Not Applicable and complete Appendix D: Explanation of Requirements Noted as
Not Applicable.

11.3 External and internal vulnerabilities are regularly identified, prioritized, and addressed.

11.3.2   External vulnerability scans are performed as follows:          •  Examine ASV scan reports.    □        □           □               □          □
         •  At least once every three months.
         •  By PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV).
         •  Vulnerabilities are resolved and ASV Program Guide
            requirements for a passing scan are met.
         •  Rescans are performed as needed to confirm that
            vulnerabilities are resolved per the ASV Program
            Guide requirements for a passing scan.

         Applicability Notes

         For initial PCI DSS compliance, it is not required that four passing scans be completed within
         12 months if the assessor verifies: 1) the most recent scan result was a passing scan, 2) the
         entity has documented policies and procedures requiring scanning at least once every three
         months, and 3) vulnerabilities noted in the scan results have been corrected as shown in a re-
         scan(s).

         However, for subsequent years after the initial PCI DSS assessment, passing scans at least
         every three months must have occurred.

         ASV scanning tools can scan a vast array of network types and topologies. Any specifics about
         the target environment (for example, load balancers, third-party providers, ISPs, specific
         configurations, protocols in use, scan interference) should be worked out between the ASV and
         scan customer.

         Refer to the ASV Program Guide published on the PCI SSC website for scan customer
         responsibilities, scan preparation, etc.

Note: For SAQ A, Requirement 11.6.1 applies to merchants that include a TPSP's inline frame (iframe) payment form on the merchant's website.

11.6.1   A change- and tamper-detection mechanism is deployed as follows:

   •  To alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including indicators of compromise, changes, additions, and deletions) to the HTTP headers and the contents of payment pages as received by the consumer browser.
                                                          •  Examine system settings and mechanism configuration settings.
                                                          •  Examine monitored payment pages.
                                                                                    ___ In Place   ___ In Place with CCW   ___ In Place with Remediation   ___ Not Applicable   ___ Not in Place

   •  The mechanism is configured to evaluate the received HTTP header and payment page.
                                                          •  Examine results from monitoring activities.
                                                                                    ___ In Place   ___ In Place with CCW   ___ In Place with Remediation   ___ Not Applicable   ___ Not in Place

   •  The mechanism is configured to evaluate the received HTTP header and payment page.
   •  The mechanism functions are performed as follows:
         –  At least once every seven days
            OR
         –  Periodically (at the frequency defined in the entity's targeted risk analysis, which is performed according to all elements specified in Requirement 12.3.1).
                                                          •  Examine the mechanism configuration settings.
                                                          •  Examine configuration settings.
                                                          •  Interview responsible personnel.
                                                          •  If applicable, examine the targeted risk analysis.
                                                                                    ___ In Place   ___ In Place with CCW   ___ In Place with Remediation   ___ Not Applicable   ___ Not in Place

   Applicability Notes

   The intention of this requirement is not that an entity installs software in the systems or browsers of its consumers, but rather that the entity uses techniques such as those described under Examples in the PCI DSS Guidance column (of PCI DSS Requirements and Testing Procedures) to prevent and detect unexpected script activities.
   This requirement is a best practice until 31 March 2025, after which it will be required and must be fully considered during a PCI DSS assessment.

SAQ Completion Guidance:
If a merchant uses URL redirects, where the merchant hosts the page(s) on their website(s) that provides the address (the URL) of the merchant's payment page/form to the merchant's customers, the merchant marks this requirement as Not Applicable and completes Appendix D: Explanation of Requirements Noted as Not Applicable.

Maintain an Information Security Policy

*Requirement 12: Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs*

*Note: Requirement 12 specifies that merchants have information security policies for their personnel, but these policies can be as simple or complex as needed for the size and complexity of the merchant's operations. The policy document must be provided to all personnel, so they are aware of their responsibilities for protecting payment terminals, any paper documents with account data, etc. If a merchant has no employees, then it is expected that the merchant understands and acknowledges their responsibility for security within their store(s).*

                                                                                          Response♦

         description for each of the services provided.

         Applicability Notes

         The use of a PCI DSS compliant TPSP does not make an entity PCI DSS compliant, nor does it
         remove the entity's responsibility for its own PCI DSS compliance.

           process, or transmit on behalf of the entity, or to the
           extent that they could impact the security of the entity's
           CDE.

         Applicability Notes

         The exact wording of an acknowledgment will depend on the agreement between the two
         parties, the details of the service being provided, and the responsibilities assigned to each
         party. The acknowledgment does not have to include the exact wording provided in this
         requirement.

         Evidence that a TPSP is meeting PCI DSS requirements (for example, a PCI DSS Attestation
         of Compliance (AOC) or a declaration on a company's website) is not the same as a written

         Applicability Notes

         Where an entity has an agreement with a TPSP for meeting PCI DSS requirements on behalf of
         the entity (for example, via a firewall service), the entity must work with the TPSP to make sure
         the applicable PCI DSS requirements are met. If the TPSP does not meet those applicable PCI
         DSS requirements, then those requirements are also "not in place" for the entity.

12.8.5   Information is maintained about which PCI DSS         •  Examine policies and        □       □           □               □           □

SAQ Completion Guidance:

Selection of any of the In Place responses for requirements at 12.8.1 through 12.8.5 means that the merchant has a list of, and agreements with, service providers
they share account data with or that could impact the security of the merchant's cardholder data environment. For example, such agreements would be applicable if a
merchant uses a document-retention company to store paper documents that include account data or if a merchant's vendor accesses merchant systems remotely to
perform maintenance.

          security incident. The plan includes, but is not limited to: •  Interview personnel.
          •  Roles, responsibilities, and communication and          •  Examine documentation from
             contact strategies in the event of a suspected or          previously reported incidents.
             confirmed security incident, including notification of
             payment brands and acquirers, at a minimum.
          •  Incident response procedures with specific
             containment and mitigation activities for different types
             of incidents.
          •  Business recovery and continuity procedures.
          •  Data backup processes.
          •  Analysis of legal requirements for reporting
             compromises.
          •  Coverage and responses of all critical system
             components.
          •  Reference or inclusion of incident response
             procedures from the payment brands.

SAQ Completion Guidance:
Selection of any of the In Place responses for Requirement 12.10.1 means that the merchant has documented an incident response and escalation plan to be used for emergencies, consistent with the size and complexity of the merchant's operations. For example, such a plan could be a simple document posted in the back office that lists who to call in the event of various situations with an annual review to confirm it is still accurate, but could extend all the way to a full incident response plan including backup "hotsite" facilities and thorough annual testing. This plan should be readily available to all personnel as a resource in an emergency.
